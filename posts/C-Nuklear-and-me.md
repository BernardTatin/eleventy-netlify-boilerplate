Because I have learned **C** on books before I could use a compiler - no, Internet was not everywhere, and phones were used to talk - **C** is a language I really love, even today, even after gloomy nights searching obscure bugs in memory management.

Because **[Nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear)** seemed perfect and easy to use with **C**, I choose it to make graphical user interface.

The first contact with **Nuklear** was surprising, it was _too_ easy! It seems that I will keep it for a while.

Well, it is my first post on that blog. Not the best, I hope!
