Because I have learned C on books before I could use a compiler - yes, Internet was not everywhere and we could only talks with phones - C is a language I really love, even today, even after gloomy nights searching obscure bugs in memory management.

Because [Nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) seemed perfect and easy to use with C, I choose it to make graphical user interface.
