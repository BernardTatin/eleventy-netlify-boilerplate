## about the fonts used here

We have only three fonts:
- [Jost](https://indestructibletype.com/Jost.html) for all the headers and normal text, under the [SIL Open Font License](https://fontsarena.com/licenses-explained/),
- [Computer Modern Typewriter](https://checkmyworking.com/cm-web-fonts/), which was created by [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth), is used for code sample,
- the default [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) font for mathematics symbols and formulas.

I did not include all the files of their distribution for performance reasons.

## about the blog engine

This is a simple blog website with the [Eleventy static site generator](https://www.11ty.io), with deployment to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) which can be used as a template. It's a fork of the [{{pkg.engineauthor.name}}]({{pkg.enginerepository.url}}) _Eleventy Netlify Boilerplate_.

Includes [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) for WYSIWYG content editing, and [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling) for processing your site's form data.

For more info on installation and usage, view the [{{pkg.engineauthor.name}} repository]({{pkg.enginerepository.url}}) on GitHub.
