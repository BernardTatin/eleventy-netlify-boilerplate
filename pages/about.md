## what's that?

Some text about code, some text about the seasons and some more text will be added here later.

## about the fonts used here

For titles and header, it's [Darker Grotesque](https://fontsarena.com/darker-grotesque-by-gabriel-lam/), for the rest, it's [Proza Libre](https://fontsarena.com/proza-libre-by-bureau-roffa/). Both are under the [SIL Open Font License](https://fontsarena.com/licenses-explained/). I did not include all the files of their distribution for performance reasons.
